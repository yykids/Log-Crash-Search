## Analytics > Log & Crash Search > Console User Guide

> [Notice]
> Crash logs from new devices using the arm64e architecture (iPhone XS, XR, XS Max, and iPad Pros 3rd) can only count the number of occurrences, and analysis of crash content is not yet supported.
> We will provide analysis capabilities for new devices in the near future.

Log & Crash Search can be applied in the following order:

- Enable Service
Create a project on the console and enable Log & Crash Search.
- Send Logs
Start sending logs via Log & Crash Search SDK.
- Check Logs
  Go to **Log Search** or **App Crash Search** to find logs in many ways, like a chart or search function.

## Select Projects

Access console and select an organization and project from menu on the left. When there is no organization or project available, create one.
- Select **ORGANIZATION > PROJECT** from the menu on the left.

See the [TOAST Console Guide](https://docs.toast.com/en/TOAST/en/console-guide/) for how to create an organization and a project

## Enable Services

While a project is selected, click **Service** on top of the screen and go to **Log & Crash Search** under **Analytics** and enable it. When a service is enabled, (v) is displayed by the service name.

> [Note]
> Delivery becomes available in about five minutes after service is enabled.

When Log & Crash Search is enabled, **Analytics > Log & Crash Search** shows on the menu, with the Appkey created.

## Check Appkey

To send logs, it is required to check Appkey.

1. Click **Analytics > Log & Crash Search > Log Search** on the left navigation menu.
2. Click **URL & Appkey** on top of the screen and check Appkey.

## Send Logs

To send a log, Log & Crash Search SDK is required.
You can download an SDK from **Analytics > Log & Crash Search** of [TOAST Downloads](https://docs.toast.com/en/Download/)

> [Note]  
> When the log volume is small, the result can be applied in about five minutes.  

## Search Logs

Logs can be searched by using Log Search.

1. Click **Analytics > Log & Crash Search > Log Search**.
2. **Log Search** provides around-the-clock log-volume graphs with details.

## Guide for Lucene Query

## Overview  

It depends on the location or availability of double quotes (") or tilde (~) to serve as an operator or not.
* e.g.) Proximity searches and fuzzy searches
Also, if a search word is surrounded by double quotes ("), the whole surrounded part is searched as one phrase.
* e.g.) body:normal AND performance
* -> Search logs that contain the words, "normal" and "performance", in the body field.

* e.g.) body:"normal AND performance"
* ->Search logs containing the "normal AND performance" word in the body field

* The log result is 0, since there is no text for "normal AND performance".

To use special characters for a search, enter backslash or \ ahead of a character, to process escape.  
* Special characters at point: ```+ - && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \ /```

Special characters (including reserved words) for URL must be encoded.
* e.g.) Enter %3C for the special character, '<'.    

## Basic Search

filedname: Search Word
* Search by search word for a single field name you need.

If the field name is in the format of log.type, log.time, or log.version, batch search is available as below:
* e.g.) log.*:alpha

\_missing\_:fieldname
* Search logs that are null in the field name or do not have the field name.

\_exists\_:fieldname
* Search logs with the non-null value in the field name.

## Range Search  

| Grammar | Operations |
| --- | --- |
| [min TO max] | Search including min, max conditions |
| {min TO max} | Search excluding min, max conditions |
| {min TO max], [min TO max} | Conditions included or excluded |
| {* TO max}, {min TO *} | Only min or max conditions apply |

* Conditions can be simpler as follows:
    * e.g.) fieldname:>10

## Boolean Operators

| Operator | Significance |
| --- | --- |
| AND, &&, + | AND Opeartor |
| OR\, \|\| | OR Operator |
| NOT, !, - | NOT Operator |

The NOT operator `-` also serves as AND NOT.
* e.g.) logType:bulk -api
* -> logType: Same as bulk AND NOT API

## Wildcard Search

*replaces many letters.

* e.g.) body:performance\*
* Search logs that have a body starting with performance.

? replaces only one letter.
* e.g.) body:performance?
* Search logs that have a body field which starts with performance and responds to only one letter.

The two wildcards, such as * and ?, can also be applied in the middle of a letter.  

## Proximity Search

fiedname:"Search Word A Search Word B"~n
* Search logs that have up to n words between search word A and search word B.
* e.g.) body:"normal cron"~2

### Boosting

fieldname: Search Word A^n Search Word B
* Give more weight to some search key words to get the results higher on priority.
* e.g.) body:normal^2 cron
* Weight can be given only with real numbers bigger than 0.

Default weight is 1.

## RegEx Search

Searching with regular expression is available.  
* e.g.) To find a document including dress or press, write /[dp]ress/

## Fuzzy Search

fieldname: Search Word~n
* Search up to n letters, which are approximately close to a search word (no more than 2).
* 2 is the default number of letters.
* e.g.) logSource:logncrash-logS**ur**rce~2
